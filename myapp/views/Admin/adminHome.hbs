        Viva oral examination is a process whereby postgraduate students need to present their research or project
        result findings in front of examiners through oral presentation. Specific for the postgraduate students under
        the Master of Computer Science (MCS) program in the School of Computing,Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM),
        their research viva is the result of the studentâ€™s dissertation project. Commonly, the viva oral examination's
        procedures are performed in a traditional approach in which the viva's procedures management between the student
        and supervisor is executed through one postgraduate office clerk. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic problem,
        the physical operation of the oral viva needs to be adjusted to virtual. Hence, the manual process which has
        been implemented before also needs to be transformed according to the new environment. Furthermore, before the
        COVID-19 pandemic, the students go through the procedures physically. For example, submitting the thesis,
        documents, presentation slides, selecting examiners. On the other hand, this project will conduct the viva's
        procedures to be online. Online Document Management System for Oral Examination will assist in the documentation
        submission and examiners selection processes. This proposed system will develop the processes of the viva's
        methods of giving the necessary files to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic challenges.
